# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is a solution to the Kaggle competition "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster". It aims to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered "unsinkable" RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren't enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

In this challenge, we build a predictive model that answers the question: "what sorts of people were more likely to survive?" using passenger data (i.e., name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.).

## Dataset

The data has been split into two groups:
- `train.csv` - The training set (891 passengers)
- `test.csv` - The test set (418 passengers)

The `train.csv` file contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the "ground truth".

The `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the "ground truth" for each passenger. It's our job to predict these outcomes.
 
## Approach

Our approach to this problem involves several steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We visualize the data to understand the relationships between features and survival rates.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: We handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.

3. **Feature Engineering**: We create new features such as 'Title' from the Name column and 'FamilySize' from SibSp and Parch.

4. **Model Selection**: We use a Random Forest Classifier for this task due to its ability to handle both numerical and categorical data, as well as its robustness to overfitting.

5. **Model Evaluation**: We evaluate our model using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report on a validation set.

6. **Prediction**: Finally, we use our trained model to make predictions on the test set.

## Results

Our model achieves an accuracy of approximately X% on the validation set. The exact performance may vary slightly due to the random nature of the train-test split and the Random Forest algorithm.

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with different feature combinations
- Try other machine learning algorithms (e.g., Gradient Boosting, SVM)
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
- Use ensemble methods to combine predictions from multiple models
